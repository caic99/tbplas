Introduction
============

TBPLaS (Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation) is a package for building and solving
tight-binding models, with emphasis on handling large systems. TBPLaS implements exact
diagonalization-based methods, the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM), kernel polynomial
method (KPM), and Green's function method. Sparse matrices, Cython/FORTRAN extensions and hybrid
OpenMP+MPI parallelization are utilized for optimal performance on modern computers. The main
features of TBPLaS include:
