In this section we review briefly the formalism of tight-binding theory, since they are essential
for understanding the concepts of TBPlaS. Since it is difficult to prepare the mathematical stuff
within reStructuredText, we put the note in the attachment__. For a more detailed depiction of the
theory, see the note of `PythTB <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/formalism.html>`_ or any
formal textbooks on solid state physics.
