   :description: TBPlaS is a package for building and solving tight-binding models with emphasis
                 on large systems.                                                                                                                       


Welcome to the homepage of TBPlaS (**T**\ ight-**b**\ inding **P**\ ackage for **La**\ rge-scale
**S**\ imulation). As indicated by its name, TBPlaS is a package for building and solving
tight-binding models, with emphasis on handling large systems. Thanks to the tight-binding propagation
method (TBPM), the utilization of sparse matrices, C/FORTRAN extensions for performance-critical parts,
and hybrid OpenMP+MPI parallelization, models with millions of orbitals can be easily solved on computers
with moderate hardware. See features for a summary of the features, or have look at the gallery for
demonstrations. If you get interested, try installing TBPlaS with the instructions at installation
and start learning the package following the tutorials.
