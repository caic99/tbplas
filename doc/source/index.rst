Welcome to the homepage of TBPlaS (**T**\ ight-**b**\ inding **P**\ ackage for **La**\ rge-scale
**S**\ imulation) !

As indicated by its name, TBPlaS is a package for building and solving tight-binding models, with
emphasis on handling large systems. Thanks to the utilization of tight-binding propagation method
(TBPM), sparse matrices, C/FORTRAN extensions, and hybrid OpenMP+MPI parallelization, TBPlaS is
capable of solving models with millions of orbitals on computers with moderate hardware.

See :ref:`Features` for a summary of the features, or have look at the :ref:`Gallery` for demonstrations.
If you are interested, try installing TBPlaS with the instructions at :doc:`install` and start learning
the code following the :doc:`tutorial/index`.
