Methodology
-----------

TBPLaS is build on the tight-binding theory. So you need to a have a general idea of it in order
to understand the concepts of TBPLaS. A brief note on the formulation is avaiable at
`this link <attachments/tbnote.pdf>`_. More detailed depiction of the tight-binding theory can be
found in textbooks of solid state physics.

If you want to know more about methodology behind TBPLaS, especially the large-scale tight-binding
propagation method (TBPM), you may have a look at the following papers:

Implementation
--------------
An overview on the concepts of TBPLaS, as well as the common workflow, is given in the arXiv paper
in ref. 4. It will provide the users and developers a general picture of the design philosophy of
TBPLaS.
