Background
==========

In this section we review briefly the formalism of tight-binding theory, since they are essential
for understanding the concepts of TBPLaS. Since it is difficult to prepare the mathematical stuff
within reStructuredText, we put the note in the attachment__. A more detailed depiction of the
theory can be found in textbooks of solid state physics.
