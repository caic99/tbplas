Installation instructions for Tipsi
===================================

Explanation before starting
---------------------------

Tipsi(TIght-binding Propagation SImulator) is a developing software
with python interface and fortran implementation. A python environment
with version over 3 and a fortran compiler which at least support
Fortran 2003 is needed.

Dependences and requirements before compiling
---------------------------------------------

1. System requirement
    Currently Tipsi is only available for linux system.

2. Compiler and environment requirements
    * Fortran compiler with Fortran 2003 support
      Intel Fortran(version >= 2016) with MKL is highly recommended
      GNU Fortran(version >= 5.0) is an alternative
      Other compilers are not tested, but in theory they will be OK
    * Python 3
      Anaconda with Python 3 is recommended
      Plain CPython 3 has been tested

3. Dependencies for Python
  Compulsory:
    numpy, scipy, matplotlib
  Alternative:
    h5py

Procedure of installation
-------------------------

1. Change the fortran compiler and libraries(MKL) in `setup.cfg`.
   You can use default intel compiler, add MKL library,
   or use GNU compiler, but MKL is not recommended because it crashes now.

2. Type and run the command below:
    `python setup.py install --user`

Now, you can use tipsi in python using `import tipsi`.
